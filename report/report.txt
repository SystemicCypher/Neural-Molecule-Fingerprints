Neural Molecular Fingerprints Results

After a few issues with data input, there is a restriction on this fingerprinting model.
The data is padded up to 80 spaces (as the largest molecule has 77 atoms), so that does affect the fingerprint output, and attempting to
use a one-hot method worked only up to the point where the actual one-hot tensor needed to be created.
The method would only function when the input to the one-hot method was a tensor of integers. I instead used padding
and iteration to select the appropriate dense layer to pass through at each given atom. Furthermore, the code assumes
batch sizes of 1 (for fingerprint generation), which would be a point to fix in later iterations.

Model.py contains the neural fingerprint model producing functions while predictor.py has a function that generates
the predictor model as defined in the paper. With a fix to remove the effects of the padding in the fingerprint generator,
the model that's constructed should function closer to the intended one-hot model construction.
